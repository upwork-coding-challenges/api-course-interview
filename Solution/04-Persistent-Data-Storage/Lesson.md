# Persistent Data Storage

One of the main task of server side application is to store clients information safely and securely. To store clients data we use different databases. In this course we are going to use MongoDB as our database.

MongoDB is a general purpose, document-based, distributed database built for modern application developers and for the cloud era. Basically MongoDB is a NoSQL database. A database where you never find any table, join and query. It has it's own API to deal with different operations. MongoDB provides a JavaScript API to read, write in database. The query results also return JSON object that is basically JavaScript Object Notation. So with NodeJS and MongoDB you are going to spend a very good time.
