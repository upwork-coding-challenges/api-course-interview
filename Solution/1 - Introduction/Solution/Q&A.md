# How Does a REST API Work?
REST determines the structure of the API. Developers oblige to a certain set of rules when constructing the API. For instance, one rule states that linking to a URL should return some information.

A REST API leverages HTTP methods described by the RFC 2616 protocol. It uses the following requests:
- GET to fetch data
- PUT to alter the state of data (such as an object, file or block)
- POST to create data
- DELETE methods to eliminate it
