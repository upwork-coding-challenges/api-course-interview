# Outline - Designing and Building a CRUD API

RESTful NodeJS : Beginners guide to RESTful API architecture in NodeJS and Beyond

Learning Goal: 

Help Programmers that are familair with nodeJS / Javascript envirnoment to understand the RESTful api architecture, Why and When they might need to use it. At the end of this course you will understand Why REST & What are the other designs(SOAP, RPCs , GraphQL ). 

You will also learn how to How to create Restful APIs in node & How to do it the right way. We will also learn about npm modules that are most used in helping us create RESTAPIs in nodejs, We will learn about validating and sanitizing input, Security Middlewares, Authentication Middlewares (oAuth, JWT, etc). 

We will also go through OWASP Top 10 vulnerablities for REST APIs and we will try to address them & Lastly we will dive into the world of micro-service / micro-application architecture, We will see how we can deploy our RESTful design in a powerful micro-service architectures. 

At the end of the course you should be able to create RESTAPIs in Node that are secure and performant and will be scalable, This course will also set you on a path to discover further designs and dive deeper into excited world of RESTful architecture.

## Lessons

1. Introduction : Servers & Clients, Where does the RESTful fit in ? Why Bother ?

2. Brief History of Web 

3. Introduction to Representational state transfer (REST) Architecture 

4. NodeJS as a backend server (Express.js)

5. GET,PUT,POST,UPDATE & DELETE HTTP Methods & Creating a CRUD Application

6. DB for NodeJS (MongoDB,Postgres,MySQL,lowdb)

7. ODM (Mongoose for MongoDB) & ORM (Sequlize for MySQL, Postgres, MariaDB, etc)

8. Authentication (JWT,oAuth2)

9. Security (HTTPS (SSL), OWASP TOP 10)

10. Performance (HTTP2, SPDY, REDIS SERVER)

11. API Testing - Manual (POSTMAN) / Unit (Jest)

12. Documenting APIs with Swagger.js

13. PROJECT : Creating a API server that Executes Other APIs (NASA POD API & Some open APIs)

14. Micro-Service Architecture 

15. Deployments (Heroku vs GCP vs AWS, Serverless vs Lambda)

16. API endpoints conventions and some extra nuances 

17. Congratulations, What's next ? (Advance design patterns, Resources and Blogs to Follow)
