# Solution of the topic Node js, MongoDB/MySQL and CRUD

It's time to test how much you've learned during our Introduction to Nodejs, MongoDB/MySQL Database and CRUD Lesson.

- What is CRUD stands for?

CRUD is an acronym for Create, Read, Update and Delete.

- Write difference between Mongo DB and MySQL?

|             MongoDB                          |                  MySQL                |
|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| - MongoDB represents data as JSON documents.  | - MySQL represents data in tables and rows. |
| - In MongoDB, you don't need to define the schema. Instead, you just drop in documents don't even need to have the same fields.       | - MySQL requires you to define your tables and columns before you can store anything, and every row in a table must have the same columns. |
| - MongoDB uses JavaScript as query language. | - MySQL uses the Structured Query Language (SQL). |
| - MongoDB doesn't support JOIN. | - MySQL supports JOIN operations. |
| - Real-time analytics, content management, internet of things, mobile apps | - Structured data with clear schema. |
| - No schema definition required so lesser risk of attack due to design | - Risk of SQL injection attacks. |

- What is Nodejs?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.
