# Introduction to Node JS, Mongo DB/MySQL Database and CRUD.

In this lesson we will focus on introducing Node JS, Mongo DB/MySQL database and other related library which comes in handy when we work on our project later.

## Introduction to Node JS

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.

## Introduction to Mongo DB/MySQL Database

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is a database. This is the place where you store information for your websites (or applications).

[MySQL](https://www.w3schools.com/mysql/) is a database. This is the place where you store information for your websites (or applications).

## Difference between MongoDB and MySQL

|             MongoDB                          |                  MySQL                |
|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| - MongoDB represents data as JSON documents.  | - MySQL represents data in tables and rows. |
| - In MongoDB, you don't need to define the schema. Instead, you just drop in documents don't even need to have the same fields.       | - MySQL requires you to define your tables and columns before you can store anything, and every row in a table must have the same columns. |
| - MongoDB uses JavaScript as query language. | - MySQL uses the Structured Query Language (SQL). |
| - MongoDB doesn't support JOIN. | - MySQL supports JOIN operations. |
| - Real-time analytics, content management, internet of things, mobile apps | - Structured data with clear schema. |
| - No schema definition required so lesser risk of attack due to design | - Risk of SQL injection attacks. |

## Introduction to CRUD

CRUD is an acronym for Create, Read, Update and Delete. It is a set of operations we get servers to execute (POST, GET, PUT and DELETE requests respectively). This is what each operation does:

- Create (POST) - Make something

- Read (GET)- Get something

- Update (PUT) - Change something

- Delete (DELETE)- Remove something

POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE requests let us construct Rest APIs.
