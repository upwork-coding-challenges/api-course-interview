# Create Our First REST API

In this lesson we will build our first REST API. I know many of us don't have enough knowledge to build a REST API but it's totally fine. I will create this lesson very easy to understand although we don't have to understand all the stuff at a once. I want to show you how easy it is to build a simple REST API first. Then we will dive deep to build more complex APIs.

**Agenda:**

-   Install NodeJS
-   Scaffold A Simple Express Application
-   Create A Simple User
-   Get Single & Multiple Users
