# Introduction to ORM

Objectâ€“relational mapping (ORM) in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping)

Basically ORM is a simplest way deal with databases. We don't have to write any complex query and maintain complex relationship with database directly. All the complex operations will be done by ORM. ORM provide us some basic api to do all the complex operations.

There are a variety of ORM available in the market. But for MongoDB the most popular one Mongoose. In this lesson we will learn about Mongoose. Learning one ORM very carefully is very very important. It will save us a lot of time and effort.
